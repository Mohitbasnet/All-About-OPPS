Today I learned about:
Importance of OPPS
* Generality to Speciality
* You can make your own data types

Class
* Data or Property/attribute
* Functions or Behavior
* class Should be written in camelcase
* function should be written in snake case

Object:
* Object is an instance of the class.
* In python everything is object


Function vs Methods
* Methods are basically  special functions which are written inside the classes  and can be accessed by only the object of that class whereas Function is a normal function which is not inside any class and can be accessed by any objects

Constructor : __init__()
* It is a special method in which the code inside it, will automatically executed in the time of object creation of that class.
* It is also called magic method or dunder method

Common Example To Understand Constructor:
* If God is a programmer then this Universe is Class, The Human Beings are Objects and the Death is Constructor.
* We write the code which should automatically executed, when we open any website connect to the database and internet, access GPS, and configuration codes are written in the Constructor.
* Actually, the Name it self define the main goal of Constructor mean build something, create something.

Concept of self
* The everything like data or mehtods in the can only accessed by only the object of that class.
* Self is nothing but  current object of that class.
* The one method of the class communicate to another method of that calls using self which is object of that class.
* You can give anyname instead of self it just a convension.

Attributes
* The variables inside the constructor.
* When we make a object of a class then we can access the methods and attributes of that class through the object of that class.
* Using the object, we can also make new attributes from out side of the class.

Reference Variable
* Reference variable holds the objects
* It stores the address of the object in memery location. for example: p = Person(), here p is reference variable.
* We can create object without reference variable as well, like p = Person(), we don't need p but we can make it like this: Person()=this is the object of person class, p=this is the reference variable which stores the address of that object.
* An object can have multiple reference variables like, 
p= Person()
q = Person()
p = q

Pass by Reference
* We can give the object as input to the function this is pass by reference, actually, we are not giving the object but the reference variable.
* Function can also return a object

Mutablity of object 
* By Default object of the class are mutable just like list, sets but we can also make it immutable.

Instance Variale
* The instance variable is type of variable which value is different for different object. for example , self.name = name, here self.name is the instance variable.

Today I learned about:
Importance of OPPS
* Generality to Speciality
* You can make your own data types

Class
* Data or Property/attribute
* Functions or Behavior
* class Should be written in camelcase
* function should be written in snake case

Object:
* Object is an instance of the class.
* In python everything is object


Function vs Methods
* Methods are basically  special functions which are written inside the classes  and can be accessed by only the object of that class whereas Function is a normal function which is not inside any class and can be accessed by any objects

Constructor : __init__()
* It is a special method in which the code inside it, will automatically executed in the time of object creation of that class.
* It is also called magic method or dunder method

Common Example To Understand Constructor:
* If God is a programmer then this Universe is Class, The Human Beings are Objects and the Death is Constructor.
* We write the code which should automatically executed, when we open any website connect to the database and internet, access GPS, and configuration codes are written in the Constructor.
* Actually, the Name it self define the main goal of Constructor mean build something, create something.

Concept of self
* The everything like data or mehtods in the can only accessed by only the object of that class.
* Self is nothing but  current object of that class.
* The one method of the class communicate to another method of that calls using self which is object of that class.
* You can give anyname instead of self it just a convension.

# Importance of OPPS
* Generality to Speciality
* You can make your own data types

# Class
* Data or Property/attribute
* Functions or Behavior
* class Should be written in camelcase
* function should be written in snake case

# Object:
* Object is an instance of the class.
* In python everything is object


# Function vs Methods
* Methods are basically  special functions which are written inside the classes  and can be accessed by only the object of that class whereas Function is a normal function which is not inside any class and can be accessed by any objects

# Constructor : __init__()
* It is a special method in which the code inside it, will automatically executed in the time of object creation of that class.
* It is also called magic method or dunder method

# Common Example To Understand Constructor:
* If God is a programmer then this Universe is Class, The Human Beings are Objects and the Death is Constructor.
* We write the code which should automatically executed, when we open any website connect to the database and internet, access GPS, and configuration codes are written in the Constructor.
* Actually, the Name it self define the main goal of Constructor mean build something, create something.

# Concept of self
* The everything like data or mehtods in the can only accessed by only the object of that class.
* Self is nothing but  current object of that class.
* The one method of the class communicate to another method of that calls using self which is object of that class.
* You can give anyname instead of self it just a convension.

* When a object of class is made then self is automatically passed as a first arguement.

# Attributes
* The variables inside the constructor.
* When we make a object of a class then we can access the methods and attributes of that class through the object of that class.
* Using the object, we can also make new attributes from out side of the class.


# Reference Variable
* Reference variable holds the objects
* It stores the address of the object in memery location. for example: p = Person(), here p is reference variable.

# Mutablity of object
* By Default object of the class are mutable just like list, sets but we can also make it immutable.
* Address of the object can be changed

# Instance Variable
* The instance variable is type of variable which value is different for different object.

# Encapsulation
* We can access the private variable or data with the help of getter and setter methods.

# Static Variable
* Static variable is class variable which is same for all object.
it is declare  like this Classname.Variablename eg, Atm.cid


# Inheritance
* The child class can access the data and methods of parent class. this if for code reusablity. Example-Udemy

# Super keyword
* By using thid keyword you can use the methods and variables of the parent class when you need, it overlaps the concept of method and constructor overriding.

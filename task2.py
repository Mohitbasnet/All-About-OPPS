# Q-2: Bank Class
# Create a Python class called BankAccount which represents a bank account, having as attributes: accountNumber (numeric type), name (name of the account owner as string type), balance.
# Create a constructor with parameters: accountNumber, name, balance.
# Create a Deposit() method which manages the deposit actions.
# Create a Withdrawal() method which manages withdrawals actions.
# Create an bankFees() method to apply the bank fees with a percentage of 5% of the balance account.
# Create a display() method to display account details. Give the complete code for the BankAccount class.
# Eg. After making above classes and methods, on executing below code:-

# newAccount = BankAccount(2178514584, "Mandy" , 2800)

# newAccount.Withdrawal(700)

# newAccount.Deposit(1000)

# newAccount.display()
# Output:

# Account Number :  2178514584
# Account Name :  Mandy
# Account Balance :  3100 â‚¹
